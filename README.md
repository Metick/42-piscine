Welcome to my GitHub repository containing my solutions for the 42 Network Piscine! During the intense month-long coding boot camp, I participated in a series of challenges and projects designed to strengthen my programming skills and problem-solving abilities.

## About the 42 Network Piscine

The 42 Network Piscine is an intensive coding boot camp organized by 42 schools worldwide. This challenging program aims to teach fundamental programming concepts and techniques while fostering a collaborative and peer-learning environment.

During the piscine, participants work on various subjects, projects, and exercises. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics, including C programming, data manipulation, algorithms, data structures, and more. Participants are encouraged to explore, experiment, and learn from each other throughout this intense experience.

## Subjects Completed

Below is the list of Piscine subjects that I successfully completed (Some might be incomplete or have a small edge case not handled that moulinette does check for. Fuck Moulinette & Norminette):

### 01 - Shell00
Description: Introduction to the basics of shell commands and navigating the file system.

### 02 - C00
Description: Basic C programming exercises focusing on manipulating variables, loops, and conditions.

### 03 - C01
Description: More C exercises involving pointer manipulation, function declarations, and basic arithmetic operations.
