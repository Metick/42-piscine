Welcome to my GitHub repository containing my solutions for the 42 Network Piscine! During the intense month-long coding boot camp, I participated in a series of challenges and projects designed to strengthen my programming skills and problem-solving abilities.

## About the 42 Network Piscine

The 42 Network Piscine is an intensive coding boot camp organized by 42 schools worldwide. This challenging program aims to teach fundamental programming concepts and techniques while fostering a collaborative and peer-learning environment.

During the piscine, participants work on various subjects, projects, and exercises. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics, including C programming, data manipulation, algorithms, data structures, and more. Participants are encouraged to explore, experiment, and learn from each other throughout this intense experience.

## Subjects

In my repo is the list of Piscine subjects that I successfully completed (Some might be incomplete or have a small edge case not handled that moulinette does check for. Fuck Moulinette & Norminette):

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into directories, each representing the respective subjects, projects, and challenges of the 42 Network Piscine. Within each directory, you will find the source code and any relevant files associated with that particular task.
